# Welcome to the Ami Foundation Quantum Enhance Encryption

## Our Mission

We are dedicated to advancing AI technologies while providing opportunities for persons with disabilities, fostering a sense of community, and aligning our work with universal principles.

## Our Values

- **Compassion**: We care deeply about the well-being of every individual.
- **Strength**: Inspired by the resilience of our community.
- **Nurturing**: Creating a supportive environment for growth and success.
- **Exploration**: Encouraging innovation and new possibilities.

## Philosophical Foundation

Our work is guided by the **Eight Hermetic Principles**:

1. **Mentalism**: The universe is mental; thought creates reality.
2. **Correspondence**: As above, so below; as within, so without.
3. **Vibration**: Nothing rests; everything moves and vibrates.
4. **Polarity**: Everything has pairs of opposites; like and unlike are the same.
5. **Rhythm**: Everything flows in and out; everything has its tides.
6. **Cause and Effect**: Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause.
7. **Gender**: Gender is in everything; everything has masculine and feminine principles.
8. **Perspective**: The angle or direction in which a person looks at an object; the ability to understand what is important and what isn't.


# Quantum Enhanced LWE Encryption System

## Overview
The Quantum Enhanced LWE Encryption System is a robust, quantum-resistant encryption framework designed to provide secure communication in the post-quantum era. It integrates quantum resonance circuits and advanced mathematical principles to enhance security and performance.

## Installation
To install the system, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd quantum-enhanced-lwe
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the encryption system, initialize the `EnhancedQuantumLWE` class and follow the example below:

```python
from quantum_enhanced_lwe import EnhancedQuantumLWE

# Initialize the system
enhanced_lwe = EnhancedQuantumLWE()

# Generate keypair
public_key, private_key = enhanced_lwe.gen_keypair()

# Encrypt a message
message = 1
ciphertext = enhanced_lwe.quantum_enhanced_encrypt(public_key, message)

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = enhanced_lwe.decrypt(private_key, ciphertext)
print("Decrypted Message:", decrypted_message)
```
