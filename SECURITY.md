# Security Policy and Guidelines

## Security Features

The Quantum Enhanced LWE system implements several security features:

1. **Post-Quantum Security**: Resistant to quantum computing attacks
2. **Quantum Resonance Integration**: Enhanced randomness through quantum circuits
3. **Strong Key Generation**: Secure key generation using quantum-enhanced processes
4. **Error Resistance**: Built-in error correction and noise handling

## Security Levels

The system provides approximately 503 bits of post-quantum security with default parameters:
- Lattice dimension (n) = 256
- Modulus (q) = 4093
- Error distribution Ïƒ = 1.0
- Quantum resonance frequency = 4.40 GHz

## Best Practices

### Key Management
1. Generate new keys for each session
2. Never reuse keypairs
3. Securely store private keys
4. Regularly rotate keys
5. Use secure channels for key distribution

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Use secure random number generators
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Validate all inputs
4. Use constant-time operations where possible
5. Avoid side-channel leakage

### System Configuration
1. Use recommended parameter sets
2. Maintain system entropy
3. Monitor system performance
4. Keep software updated
5. Use secure hardware when possible
